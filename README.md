Financial System Database Implementation

Designed and implemented a robust Financial System database using a 3-node PostgreSQL cluster architecture, orchestrated through Docker for streamlined containerization and deployment. This architecture leveraged sharding and hash partitioning to efficiently distribute data across nodes, ensuring scalability, fault tolerance, and optimized query performance.

Key Features

PostgreSQL Cluster Architecture: Utilized sharding and hash partitioning to distribute structured data, enhancing query performance and system resilience.

Cassandra Integration: Employed Cassandraâ€™s query-first approach to efficiently manage distributed data. Focused on denormalization and scalability to support high-throughput operations such as customer account management, loan processing, and transactional queries.

Performance Benchmarking: Conducted performance benchmarks highlighting the strengths of PostgreSQL for structured data management and Cassandra for large-scale distributed queries with minimal latency.

Advanced Database Design Principles

Dockerized PostgreSQL Nodes: Ensured easy scalability and consistent development environments through Docker orchestration.

Cross-Node Querying: Implemented PostgreSQL foreign data wrappers (FDWs) to facilitate seamless querying across distributed nodes.

Cassandra Schema Design: Tailored Cassandra schemas to specific query patterns, optimizing read and write operations.

Performance Optimization: Conducted detailed performance evaluations, identifying trade-offs and proposing optimizations such as indexing strategies, compaction techniques, and connection pooling to improve efficiency.
